 MDCInkTouchController associates a MDCInkView with a UIGestureRecognizer to control the spread of
 the ink.

 Subclasses should avoid overriding the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:
 and gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: methods to avoid breaking
 MDCInkTouchControllerDelegate.

 **NOTE:** The controller does not keep a strong reference to the view to which it is attaching an
 ink view.
 It is expected that the view will keep a strong reference to its own ink controller, or that the
 view controller controlling the view will keep a strong reference to that view's ink controller.
